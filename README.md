# convection-difussion

This codes develops a flow analyais using the convection-difussion theory. The code developed analaysi three differente main cases:

- A simple channel with unidireccional flow
- A diagonal flow
- The Smith-Hutton case study

**Abstract** |  	This report is aimed to provide an introduction to the solution of convection-diffusion problems
using three case studies: parallel & diagonal flow, and the Smith-Hutton case study.
